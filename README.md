# Ray Casting Demo
  
A simple demo of ray casting. The desktop application uses OpenGL and C++ while the web application utilizes WebGL and Typescript. This was inspired by 
3DSage's video on a simple ray casting algorithm and was written to experiment with different game mechanics with ray casting.

## Controls

The direction keys are mapped to the WASD format, and `L` is held to sprint.

## Run

### C++

To build from the source code, run:
 `cd c++ && make sample; ./sample`
Or simple build the executable:
`./sample`
