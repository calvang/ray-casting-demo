# Ray Casting Demo
  
A simple demo of ray casting. The desktop application uses OpenGL and C++ while the web application utilizes WebGL and Typescript. This was inspired by 
3DSage's video on a simple ray casting algorithm and was written to experiment with different game mechanics with ray casting.
